# Optimize Db

Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database[clarification needed] in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. 
It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as an integral part of his relational model.

Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. 
It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design).

### Installing

Enter the column of tables and the program give you a
1nf , 2nf , 3nf of this database

for input you must enter primarykey of table and the columns of thable like that

```
tbl(id,name,another_columns)
```

And repeat it for all tables.
